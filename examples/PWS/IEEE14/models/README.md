This directory contains the scripts to to compute the model for IEEE 14-bus system. The
original model is provided by Ben Francis in Julia (see IEEE14_SEModel.jl). The Python
script model_IEEE14.py wraps over this Julia code. The data folder contains the buses and
network information used by the Julia code, as well as some information about how to
partition the network.
